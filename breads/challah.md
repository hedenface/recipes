# Challah

> This is my favorite bread

This was originally copied from [Easy Challah Bread Recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/172633/easy-challah-bread/). I tweaked it a bit, but not much.

## Making Method

Mixing bowl (with dough hooks)

## Ingredients

* 1 cup warm water
* 1/2 package active yeast (I used Fleischmann's ActiveDry Yeast which comes in a 1/4oz package)
* 2 tbsp honey
* 1 tsp salt
* 5 eggs
* 3.5 cups flour
* Olive oil
* Brown sugar
* Additional honey

## Prepare Dough

1. Add the water and the yeast (into your mixing bowl). The water should be warm, but not hot
1. Take 3 eggs and beat them
1. Add the honey, salt, and the beaten eggs and then whisk
1, At this point, turn the mixer on a somewhat slow spin
1. Add the flour, a little bit a time until you get all the way to the 3.5 cups
1. Add a little bit of olive oil
1. Continue mixing until it's a solid ball (this will feel like an impossible task, but just walk away for a few minutes)
1. Cover with a damp towel for about an hour until it has risen

## Prepare Egg Wash Mix

1. Take the remaining 2 eggs and beat them in a bowl
1. Add some honey and some olive oil to the bowl, and then mix thoroughly

## Instructions

1. Once the dough has risen, cut it into 3 roughly equivalent size pieces
1. The original recipe calls for rolling it (on flour and covered in flour), but I've found that simply stretching it is just fine
1. Get a baking pan or cookie sheet
1. Put all 3 dough lengths next to each other and pinch one end together
1. Braid the pieces of dough lengths, when complete pinch the other end together
1. Brush the exposed surface with the egg wash mix
1. Sprinkle some (very lightly) brown sugar on top
1. Bake at 350 until the bread is a light brown, and when you smack it with a spoon it sounds hollow
1. Enjoy!
