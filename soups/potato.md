# Potato Soup

> This is my favorite soup

## Cooking Method

Crockpot

## Ingredients

* 8 cups chicken broth
* 3 cups milk
* 1 cup sour cream
* 5 tbsp butter
* salt
* pepper
* garlic
* chili powder
* flour
* 1 large red onion
* 10 medium sized red potatos
* 1 oz chives
* 1 lb bacon
* shredded cheddar

## Preparation

1. Cook the bacon (I bake in the oven on a rack) and keep the grease
1. Cut the bacon into bits
1. Cut the chives into tiny pieces
1. Cut the onion into small pieces
1. Cut the potatos into medium to medium large pieces (I leave the skin on)

## Instructions

1. Add broth, milk, sour cream, butter, and bacon grease to the crockpot
1. Turn crockpot on high. Once it heats up, add a bit (handful?) of flour and whisk
1. Add onions, potatos, and garlic to the crockpot and turn the crockpot to low
1. Let it cook for a long time
1. Once the potatos are tender, put a cup or two of the soup (with plenty of potatos and onions) into a blender and blend, then return it to the crockpot and stir
    *hint*: If you want an extra thick soup, add some flour to blender before turning it on
1. Add salt, pepper, chili powder to taste
1. Once it's done, add the chives and bacon bits
1. Add cheddar per serving
