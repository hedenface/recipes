# Pie Crust

> This is my favorite crust

This makes just enough crust for one pie. I don't want to measure the last pan I used to tell you the size (I will one day). It's probably enough for you.

## Making Method

Food processor

## Ingredients

* 3.5 cups flour
* 2 full sticks of butter
* some brown sugar (used before the egg)
* 1 egg
* some more brown sugar (used after the egg)
* 4 tbsp of VERY COLD water

## Preparation

1. Put the flour and the pre-egg brown sugar in the food processor
1. Use the buttons at your leisure to mix that stuff
1. Cut the butter into pieces. Lots of recipes call for half inch cubes. I'm almost positive it doesn't matter, but cut them into half inch cubes

## Instructions

1. Add the butter cubes to the food processor on top of the flour mixture you made during prep
1. Add the water to the food processor on top of the flour mixture (with all the butter) you made during prep
1. Mix that shit until it turns into dough (it might not feel like it will turn into dough. keep mixing)
