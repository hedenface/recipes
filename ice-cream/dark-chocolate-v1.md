# Dark Chocolate Ice Cream version 1

> This is my favorite ice cream

Last year I picked up an ice cream maker at a garage sale, and I had stumbled upon some dark chocolate ice cream recipe. But when I went to make some today, I couldn't find that recipe.

All the recipes I found required cooking. I don't want to cook to make ice cream.

So this is version 1 of my dark chocolate ice cream recipe.

## Method

Ice cream maker. One of the spinny metal buckets surrounded by ice and salt.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 tbsp salt

## Instructions

1. Mix all the shit together in a bowl
2. Pour it into the ice cream maker
3. Follow your ice cream maker instructions.
